            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Wherin howſoeuer the Lord haue graciouſlie vouchafed to declare his incomprehenſible power, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing ſo miraculous a worke, and to manifeſt his vnſpeakable loue not onely in the multitude and varietie, but in the euidencie thereof; ſo that euen bleare eyed men &amp; barbers (as is in the common by word) may cleerely perceiue the ſame, yet the ſtrength of ſinne hath ſo not onely obſcured, but as it were defaced, though not the ſight, yet the power and efficacie of Gods fauour, with the fruites and effects which ſhould followe therevpon; that ſome through naturall blindnes and dimnes of their eyes, cannot behold them: other ſome againe through

So fewe are there found in the world now adaies that profite by them to faith vnfeigned, and humble thankfulnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him that plentifully hath prouided the ſame for their good, if they could tell how to accept and vſe the ſame. The contemplation and memorie wherof (I willingly and vnfeignedly confeſſe it) leaueth behind it no ſmall ſkarre, but a great wound rather in mine heart, and that not only ſo much for mine owne iniquitie in that behalfe (though I knowe the ſame to bee high and hainous) as for the common abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, that euery where as a mightie ſtreame that will not be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and forcible floud that cannot be withſtood, ouerfloweth all; and for the fearefull deſolation that in all probabilitie and likelihood of mans iudgement will enſue therevpon, becauſe howſoeuer God be of long ſuffering and of great goodnes, yet he cannot, nor will not (for we are ſure he is zealous ouer his owne glorie) continuallie ſuffer the vile and abominable of the world to trample and tread vnder their beaſtlie feete his exceeding bleſsings and ſingular fauours. And yet I cannot hide this within my ſelfe, but muſt of neceſsitie breake foorth into the declaration thereof, that I am againe ſomewhat recomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in that whether ſoeuer I caſt mine eyes whether at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, I certainlie beholde, and that without deceit of ſight, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all eſtates and degrees of men, high, lowe, rich, poore, young, olde, noble, vnnoble, magiſtrates, miniſters, and people, and ſundrie of them of my Chriſtian acquaintance, on whoſe behalfe I daylie offer vp vnto God through Chriſt the duetie of thanks giuing, perſwading my ſelf further, that there is vpon the face of the earth a mightie num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber beſides (though not known to me) whom God hath pleaſed in the multitude of his mercies doubtles, and for much good towards them and others in them, not onely to ſingle and cull out as it were from the huge heape and wicked fellowſhip of the polluted and prophane, but richlie to repleniſh and adorne them (as it were with moſt precious pearles) with the ſingular graces of ſound knowledge, ſtedfaſt faith, comfortable feeling, vnfeigned obedience, and ſundrie ſuch like holie and heauenlie gifts. Amongſt whom, your ſexe rightly conſidered, and the place you haue been in wiſely reſpected, and your preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate well weighed, I know few matchable with you (good Madame:
<pb facs="tcp:20649:4"/> flatterie is farre from my words, I humbly thanke God for it, &amp; I hope pride remoued farre from your ſelfe in hearing your owne praiſe, as I wiſh enuie may bee from others as in regard of your due commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and not many to go beyond you. For though to be borne not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of worſhipful parents, but of a ſanctified ſtock, be ſome thing both before God and man: and though learned and holie education bee a good helpe towards the reformation of our corruption, and as it were the inſtilling of another nature into vs: and though to be richlie ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in holy matrimonie be a token doubtles of Gods great fauour and loue: and though to haue in the vndefiled mariage bed, a bleſſed ſeed and lawfull iſſue, be a ſpecial bleſsing &amp; mercie from God: &amp; though to leade and liue a vertuous and vnreproueable life in the ſight of men (who are wont neglecting themſelues, with euill and curious eyes to looke vpon others) bee a happie thing: (with all which fauours you haue by the diuine prouidence, been euen laden as it were in your birth, bringing vp, youth, old age, virginitie, mariage, widowhood and poſteritie) yet becauſe many bee degenerate and ſtart aſide from their anceſtors godlines: &amp; ſome through careleſnes cauſe to periſh the coſt that hath been beſtowed vpon them in good bringing vp: and others make themſelues both in ſingle and maried life lothſome to the Lord, and infamous before men, becauſe either they haue not begun well, or haue not held on vnto the end: and other ſome by euill example, haue done the children of their wombe more hurt in the world, than they haue done them good in bringing them foorth to behold the light of the Sunne: and other ſome haue added to the weakenes of their ſexe, not watchfulnes againſt ſinne, as their duetie required, but laied the raines of their ſeuerall iniquities and manifold inticements to euill in their owne neckes: and many haue miſuſed their places of honor and credit to all licentiouſnes of the fleſh, and careleſnes of God, and of the waies of his worſhip, and ſo conſequently of eternal ſaluation: (from all which inconueniences and miſchiefes the Lord hath mercifullie kept you in euerie condition of life wherein he hath been pleaſed to place you) me thinketh you haue wherein to reioyce, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſo much in the things themſelues, freelie and plentifullie beſtowed vpon you, as in the happie continuance and mightie encreaſe of theſe his goodneſſes in you, you alſo hauing receiued grace from God to beautifie them with an vnblameable &amp; holy conuerſation. By meanes whereof it is come to paſſe, that as you are much beloued at home in the midſt of Gods ſaincts and faithfull ſeruants here, and theſe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:20649:5"/> common profeſſors, but many worthie miniſters: (for kindnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom, and particularlie towards my ſelfe, I doo humblie here in all our names thanke GOD, and you as his gracious inſtrument) ſo you are made truely famous abroad in forraine Churches and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, &amp; highly reuerenced of many worthie men there, indued doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les with ſingular graces for Gods glory, and the building vp of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the fellowſhip of Saincts. But what meane I to enter into this broad field of your Chriſtian commendation, where breath would rather faile me, and time I am ſure, with abilitie to wade into it as I ſhould, than matter any manner of way bee wanting. Giue me leaue therefore (good Madame) I beſeech you to deſiſt from your praiſe, (which I knowe you doo not willingly heare, though it be deſerued as on your part, and though perhaps it might bee as a quicke ſpurre in the dull ſides of others to prouoke them to good things) and to turne my ſpeach to exhortation rather and comfort. The courſe that you are entered into, and the race that now you haue a long time runne in, is holie and honorable. Hold on therfore in the ſame chearefullie, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the manifold hinderances that within and without bee caſt in your way to turne you aſide, if it might be: and bee not wearie of well doing at any hand, for as you knowe that your profeſsion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it, ſo God hath promiſed that the time wil come wherein you ſhall reape (as the ſaincts of God haue done before you) if you faint not. Let the aſſured faithfulnes and infinite power of him, that hath in his word made you large promiſes, be a pricke vnto you herein. And foraſmuch as he hath giuen you grace to begin well, and to hold on hetherto, doubt not, but he that hath both the will and the deed in his owne hands to beſtowe them where and as it pleaſeth him, will make perfect in you euery good worke, euen till the day of Ieſus Chriſt. Is it poſsible, that that incorruptible crowne of eternall glorie, which in his onely beloued he hath prepared for you, ſhould fade away? Vpon theſe things I beſeech you (hauing caſt away worldly cares) fixe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie the eye of your faith, that you may end your old yeeres in the Lords peace, and be indeed gathered vnto your fathers comfortablie, ſaying, as that holie Apoſtle old <hi>Paule</hi> ſaied: <hi>I haue fought a good fight, I haue finiſhed my courſe, I haue kept the faith: from henceforth there is laied vp for me the crowne of righteouſnes, which the Lord the righteous Iudge ſhall giue me at that day; and not to me onely, but vnto all them alſo that loue his appearing.</hi> Your learned father, your honorable huſband, your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brother, your deare ſiſters ſome of them, and (if I bee not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
<pb facs="tcp:20649:5"/> ſome alſo of your owne holie ſeede (all of them hauing yeelded vp their ſpirites in the faith and feare of GOD) are I doubt not gone thether before you: and why ſhould you your ſelfe, or any other thinke that you ſhould be ſundred from them? As for the lengthning of your life, aboue many before reckoned, ſurely God hath done it for his owne glorie, and the good of his Church, into which alſo you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religiouſlie gathered as a ſound member thereof, you haue euen in that an aſſured teſtimonie giuen vnto you, that warfaring here with his ſaincts as you doo, againſt ſinne, the world and the diuell, you ſhall in good time, through him that hath loued you and waſhed you in his bloud, become more than a conquerour, and eternallie triumph toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them and the reſt in heauen. Till which time, as I reſt reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that God the author and perfecter of euery good thing in all his, will not withdrawe his gracious hand from you in any grace, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie ſpirituall and heauenlie: ſo I am certainlie perſwaded that manie ſuch as are led by his ſpirit, &amp; know you in Chriſt Ieſus, and loue you in the trueth, will not (GOD ayding them) neglect any duetie either outward or inward, that poſsiblie they can performe to further that worke.

<pb facs="tcp:20649:6"/> this fauour, that as they wil not reiect any good thing in it for any euil that may be found or ſuſpected to be therin, neither yet admit any euil for the goods ſake, but in a diſcerning ſpirit refuſe the one and receiue the other: ſo they will aſsiſt me with their praiers to God for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of any good thing that is within me, to Gods glorie, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of his people; and in much loue, according to the ſpirit of loue wherwith they are repleniſhed, either Chriſtianly couer that which is amiſſe, or curteouſlie cure it. And as for you (good Madame) though I reſt perſwaded that it ſhall bee well accepted of you, yet can I not but againe &amp; againe beſeech you to receiue it, not only as from the hand, but as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart of him, who, if either his poore praiers in abſence, or ſpeach in preſence, or any thing els either within him or without him, could any many manner of way, either further you, or anſwere ſome part of that chriſtian kindnes which he hath receiued from you, would not bee wanting in any duetie toward you or yours that GOD ſhal inable him to performe. Now the very God of peace ſanctifie you throughout; and grant that your whole ſpirit, ſoule and bodie may be kept blameles vnto the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>London,</hi> the xxv. of this September. 1589.</p>
